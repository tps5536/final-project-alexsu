# Repo for Final Project 

Here is where you will store all information for your final project. 

The official rubric for the final project and the initial EDA can be found in the "Rubrics" folder (and on Canvas). 


Reminders: 

- You **MUST** store your data in this repo. (If you are webscraping, you must include the websraping code in your final report.)
  - Note, GitHub has file size limit of 100MB, you should not run into this issue for this project. But if you do, come see me during office hours and we can talk about how to handle this situation. 
- **PUSH** your changes to GitHub (it is part of the final grade). 
- Check Canvas for all due dates
- Submit the final report as and RNotebook to Canvas
- Submit the final checklist to Canvas. (this is also part of the final grade.) Only complete the checklist once your final project submission RNotebook is finalized.
